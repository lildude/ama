# Ask @lildude Anything!

This is a quick little ask-me-anything type of repository, because I'm not famous 
enough – yet :wink: – to have a Reddit AMA, in which you can ask me anything about Solaris, GitHub, running, paleo, low-carb-high-fat (LCHF) or quite frankly, anything you please. It's forked from [@holman's ama repo](https://github.com/holman/ama), used by several of my colleagues, and seems like a pretty fantastic idea in lieu of traditional blog comments, email, and the like.

### Ask a question

Asking a question is as easy as [creating a new issue](https://github.com/lildude/ama/issues/new) on this repo.

I'll try to answer it as soon as I can get to it. Once I answer I'll close the issue just so I know what I've covered, but don't worry- if you have any further questions just respond in the thread and I'll get back to you soon. Feel free to ask a question on any old issue too, even if you didn't create it.

### Read some questions

Check out the [Closed Issues](https://github.com/lildude/ama/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=closed&page=1) filter on this repository to browse questions I've answered in the past. I try to use this as an email replacement that everyone can see, so feel free to dig into some of the older threads.

### Twitter

If you have something quick and easy, just ping me on Twitter. 140 characters makes everyone more efficient. I'm [@lildude](https://twitter.com/lildude) on Twitter.
